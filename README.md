# Front End Challenge - Vehicles

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Running the project

Open the project with the editor of your preference

```bash
   #To install all dependencies
   npm install

   #To run the project on your localhost
   npm run dev

```

### Observation

I could not obtain certain information in the api, so I've created
a function who works as mock to the missing data.
